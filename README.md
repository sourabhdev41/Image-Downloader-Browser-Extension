# Image Downloader — Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that scans any webpage and lets you download images individually or all at once.

## Features

- Detects all images on the current page
- Thumbnail preview for each image
- Filter images by filename or URL
- Filter by minimum image size
- Download individual images
- Download all images with one click
- Duplicate filtering
- Clean black and white minimal UI

## How It Works

Click the extension icon on any page. The popup scans the page for images from:

- `<img>` tags (including `srcset` and lazy-load attributes)
- CSS background images
- `<picture>` and `<source>` elements
- `<a>` links pointing to image files
